Dear Sir/Ma'am,

I am writing to explain why I have not developed the UI for this machine task.

As a Backend Developer, my expertise lies in API development. I have a strong understanding of building APIs, and I find it relatively easy due to my familiarity with the process. While I do have some knowledge of HTML and CSS, 
I acknowledge that it's insufficient for creating a comprehensive UI. My proficiency in JavaScript is limited, and I am not particularly enthusiastic about UI development. This lack of focus on UI, along with my limited free time, has contributed to the delay.

Additionally, my current circumstances are challenging, as my grandfather is hospitalized, requiring my presence and attention. 
This has further impacted my availability and capacity to dedicate time to UI development. However, I have developed APIs based on the functionality mentioned in the task.

I hope you understand my situation and the reasons behind my decision.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Akash Suresh
